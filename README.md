# FDF-42
The program involves basics of graphic programming with miniLibX

## About
The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. This project is about creating a simplified graphic “wireframe” (“fils de fer” in french,
hence the name of the project) representation of a relief landscape linking various points (x, y, z) via segments. The coordinates of this landscape are stored in a file passed as a parameter to your program.

## Main project instructions
#### General Instructions
- Project must be written in C in accordance with [the Norm](https://github.com/R4meau/minishell/blob/master/norme.en.pdf).
- Program cannot have memory leaks.
- No Segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.
- Cannot use global variables.
- Must use the miniLibX. Either in the version that is available on the system, or from its sources.
- Allowed to use the following functions:
  - *open, read, write, close*
  - *malloc, free*
  - *perror, strerror*
  - *exit*
  - All the functions defined in the `math` library (-lm and man 3 math)
  - All the functions defined in the `miniLibX` library.
  
#### Mandatory part
- Must have 2 type of projection but you stay free to choose the type of projection: parallel, iso, conic.
- Must be able to quit the program by pressing `esc`.
- The use of images from `minilibX` is strongly encouraged.
- Find attached a binary called fdf.
